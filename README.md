# wtc4_heatwave
Heat wave in the fourth whole-tree chamber experiment.

This repository contains R code to process climate, physiology, and growth data from a whole-tree chamber heatwave experiment at Western Sydney University. 

To use this code, I recommend that you clone this repository into an Rstudio project by copying the SSH (or HTTPS) link on the right, and pasting the link into a new Rstudio project URL (File > New Project > Version Control > Git). You will also need git. This process is described in useful detail here: http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/ . The code within "analysis.R" will download all of the raw data, place them in the "data" folder, and recreate all of the figures in the "output" folder. Send John an e-mail if you have trouble, and he will try to help you out (jedrake AT esf.edu).

Experimental details

A locally endemic and threatened woodland tree species (Eucalyptus parramattensis) was selected for this experiment. Seed was acquired from Harvest Seeds and Native Plants (Terry Hills, NSW, Australia) and germinated in a local shade house. Six potted seedlings were placed into each whole-tree chamber (WTC) and the experimental warming treatment (+3 deg C) was initiated on 28 Oct 2015. One seedling was planted into the soil within each WTC on 23 Dec 2015; at that time average seedling height was 60 cm.We added a heatwave treatment to the long-term warming treatment, resulting in a 2x2 factorial design with three replicate trees in each treatment combination (n = 3). As heatwaves often occur during conditions with low soil water availability, we withheld irrigation for one month, leading to dry surface soils during the heatwave. We then implemented an experimental heatwave during the Austral Spring-Summer, consisting of four sunny days with a maximum Tair of 43-44 °C and a maximum VPD of 5-6 kPa. We considered this an extreme but biologically reasonable “heatwave of the future” for this location. We measured whole-canopy exchanges of CO2 and H2O, leaf temperatures, leaf thermal tolerance, and leaf and branch hydraulic status.
